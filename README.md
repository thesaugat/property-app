##Suburb Scout — NSW Property Insights (React Native)

One map-first mobile app for NSW buyers and renters to compare suburbs on price trends, safety, schools, commute, and development activity—with smart alerts for nearby Development Applications (DAs).

##Why this app?

Finding a place to live in NSW means piecing together info from dozens of sites: recent sales, crime trends, school zones, commute, flood/elevation, and what’s being built nearby. Suburb Scout brings the high-signal indicators into a single, fast, mobile-first experience you can actually use during inspections.

##Core Value

Compare 3 suburbs in seconds using consistent, trusted indicators.

Map overlays that matter (school catchments, elevation, DA activity).

Actionable alerts (e.g., “New DA within 500m of your saved address”).
